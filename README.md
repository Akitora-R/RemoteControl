# Non-Intrusive Remote Control Solution
## Project Overview

This project is developed based on WinForm, utilizing a video capture card and the CH9329 chip to implement a non-intrusive remote control solution. By capturing the screen image of the remote device through the video capture card and simulating keyboard and mouse operations with the CH9329 chip, users can remotely control the device without direct physical interaction.
